# Industrial Defect Detection and Image Processing Pipeline
 
## Overview
This project focuses on detecting surface defects in industrial components using image processing techniques. It demonstrates:
1. **Pixel-level analysis** by extracting intensity values and visualizing histograms.
2. **Image processing** using grayscale conversion, edge detection, and contour detection to highlight defects.
3. **Image format conversions** between PNG, JPEG, and TIFF, with compression for optimized storage.
 
## Technologies Used:
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
 
## How to Run:
1. Install dependencies:
